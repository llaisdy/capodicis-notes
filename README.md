# capodicis-notes
A simple Chrome extension that allows you to

* Make notes on any webpage
* Mare a 'webpage' as done, whatever that means to you. For example it could mean you are doing research on different makes of car to buy, and when you have finished the research for a particular model you click done.
* A summary of pages, notes and whether they are done.

Notes for developers and contributers:

* Some of the code is written in the Elm Language, a language that compiles to Javascript. So make sure you have this installed if you want to build (see http://elm-lang.org/install)
* I use Windows and a bash to run make.sh, but I am sure this will work OK on Linux or Mac.
